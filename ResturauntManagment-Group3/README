For testing subgroup 3 (tests in "tests.spec.js"):

make sure all dependencies are installed (http, supertest, fs, mysqp2/promise, bcrypt, fs.promises)
to install, type in terminal:

$ npm install <dependency_to_install>

This is assuming you already have node.js installed.
To run the tests, install jest, using the same method, and once installed type:

$ npx jest tests.spec.js

npx designates that jest is installed locally, if you have it installed globally than you can ignore that part.
